I received my PhD from the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at University of Toronto, co-supervised by Drs. [Stephen Wright](https://wright.eeb.utoronto.ca/) and [John Stinchcombe](http://stinchcombe.eeb.utoronto.ca). I investigated the evolutionary genomics of selection across haploid and diploid life stages in both angiosperm and moss species.  

Before my PhD, I received my BSc in Biological Sciences (major) and BE in Software Engineering (minor) at Sichuan University.

My CV is availabe [here](https://imengyuan.github.io/files/CV_MengYuan_2025.pdf) (updated Sept 2025).
