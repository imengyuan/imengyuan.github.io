I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at the University of Toronto, co-supervised by [Stephen Wright](https://wright.eeb.utoronto.ca/research/) and [John Stinchcombe](http://stinchcombe.eeb.utoronto.ca). I'm interested in quantitative genetics and evolutionary genomics. 

I received my B.S. in Biological Sciences with a minor in Software Engineering at Sichuan University.
