## Interests
* Computational Biology
  * My interest lies in the general area of computional biology/bioinformatics. My past experience involves chloroplast genomics, trancriptomics and population genetics. See my notes and scripts on bioinformatics [here](https://github.com/imengyuan/Bioinfo-pipelines) (a little messy...).
* Botany
  * I'm the co-founder and former president of Botany Association of Sichuan University. I love writing popular-scientific blog posts about common plants in campus, see links [here](https://imengyuan.github.io/blog/2018-03-23-plant-articles/).
* Software Developing
  * I've written several programs and find it exciting to develop new platforms and helpful softwares. Check my [Github](https://github.com/imengyuan) for details.
