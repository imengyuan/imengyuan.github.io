Hi I'm Meng Yuan, a fourth-year undergraduate in computational biology from [Sichuan University](http://en.scu.edu.cn/). I will be graduating in June 2019 with a major in Software Engineering and a minor in Biological Science. My CV is availabe [here](https://imengyuan.github.io/files/CV_MengYuan_Nov2018.pdf) (updated Nov. 2018).


## News

__Oct 2018 - present__: Now I'm doing my graduation project on plant sex chromosome evolution with Professor [Stephen Wright](http://www.eeb.utoronto.ca/people/d-faculty/Wright.htm?quot;%20title=) from University of Toronto.

__July - Oct 2018__ï¼š In summer 2018 I was a [Mitacs](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship) Globalink intern in Simon Fraser University working with Professor [Jim Mattsson](https://www.sfu.ca/biology/people/profiles/jmattsso.html) on conifer bark transcriptomics. 


## Interests
* Computational Biology
  * My interest lies in the general area of computional biology and bioinformatics(slightly difference between these two). My past experience involves chloroplast genomics, trancriptomics and population genetics. See my notes and scripts on bioinformatics [here](https://github.com/imengyuan/Bioinfo-pipelines).
* Plants
  * I'm the founder and former president of the Fantastic Botany Club in Sichuan University. I've written many popular-scientific articles on plants(Chinese), see links [here](https://imengyuan.github.io/blog/2018-03-23-plant-articles/).
* Software Developing
  * I've written several programs and find it exciting to develop new platforms and helpful softwares. Check my [Github](https://github.com/imengyuan) for details.
