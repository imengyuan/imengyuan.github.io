I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at the University of Toronto, co-supervised by Dr. [Stephen Wright](https://wright.eeb.utoronto.ca/research/) and Dr. [John Stinchcombe](http://stinchcombe.eeb.utoronto.ca). I'm interested in plant evolutionary genomics. My CV is availabe [here](https://imengyuan.github.io/files/CV_MengYuan_2024.pdf) (updated Oct. 2024).

I received my B.S. in Biological Sciences with a minor in Software Engineering at Sichuan University in 2019.

For my PhD thesis, I'm interested in the evolutionary genomics of plant gametophytic selection. Check out my [Research](https://imengyuan.github.io/research/) page for more information. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in my work and want to chat :)
