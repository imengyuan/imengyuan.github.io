Hi I'm Meng Yuan, a third-year undergraduate in computational biology and will graduate in 2019. This is an interdisciplinary program in [Sichuan University](http://en.scu.edu.cn/) and I'll graduate with a major in Software Engineering and a minor in Biological Science. I'm a research assistant in the life science college working on chloroplast genomes, surpervised by Professor [Yan Yu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yan_Yu33). 


## News
I'm right now a research intern in Simon Fraser University working with Professor [Jim Mattsson](https://www.sfu.ca/biology/people/profiles/jmattsso.html). After this internship I will start doing my final-year project on population genetics and evolutionary genomics.


## Interests
* Computational Biology
  * My interest lies in the general area of computional biology and bioinformatics(slightly difference between these two). My past experience involves chloroplast genomics, trancriptomics and population genetics. See my notes and scripts on bioinformatics [here](https://github.com/imengyuan/Bioinfo-pipelines).
* Plants
  * I'm the founder and former president of the Fantastic Botany Association of Life Science College in Sichuan University. I've written many popular-scientific articles on plants(Chinese), see links [here]().
* Software Developing
  * I've written several programs and find it exciting to develop new platforms and helpful softwares. Check my [Github](https://github.com/imengyuan) for details.
