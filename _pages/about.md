I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at the University of Toronto, co-supervised by Dr. [Stephen Wright](https://wright.eeb.utoronto.ca/research/) and Dr. [John Stinchcombe](http://stinchcombe.eeb.utoronto.ca). I'm interested in quantitative genetics and evolutionary genomics. My CV is availabe [here](https://imengyuan.github.io/files/CV_MengYuan_Sept2020.pdf) (updated Sept. 2020).

I received my B.S. in Biological Sciences with a minor in Software Engineering at Sichuan University.

Currently I'm studying the evolutionary genomics of plant gametophytic selection, e.g., the relative importance of antagonistic pleiotropy and positive covariance between the sporophytic and gametophytic stages of plant life cycle, and the possibility of ploidally antagonistic selection maintaining genetic variation.
