I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at the University of Toronto, co-supervised by Dr. [Stephen Wright](https://wright.eeb.utoronto.ca/research/) and Dr. [John Stinchcombe](http://stinchcombe.eeb.utoronto.ca). I'm interested in quantitative genetics and evolutionary genomics. My CV is availabe [here](https://imengyuan.github.io/files/CV_MengYuan_Oct2020.pdf) (updated Oct. 2020).

I received my B.S. in Biological Sciences with a minor in Software Engineering at Sichuan University.

Currently I'm studying the evolutionary genomics of plant gametophytic selection. I'm interested in answering: 1) what's the genomic prevalence for evolutionary conflict between the sporophytic and gamatophytic phases in plant lifecycle? 2) how does this conflict influence phenotypic and genomic evolution in plants? 

Check out the [Research](https://imengyuan.github.io/research/) page for more information. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in my research and want to chat :)
