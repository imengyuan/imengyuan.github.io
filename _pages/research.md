## Current Research

(under construction)

I'm studying the evolutionary genomics of plant gametophytic selection, e.g., the relative importance of antagonistic pleiotropy and positive covariance between the sporophytic and gametophytic stages of plant life cycle, and the possibility of ploidally antagonistic selection maintaining genetic variation.
