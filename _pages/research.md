In plants the gametes come from a separate life stage called gametophyte. Plants alternate their lifecycles between the gametophytes (n) and the sporophytes (2n). These two life stages are adapted to different environments. 

In flowering plants, gametophytes include ovule and pollen, they are smaller, have simpler structure and are dependent on the diploid sporophytes. Most evolutionary studies in flowering plants focus on the sporophytes, selection on the gametophyte stage is under-investigated.

During my PhD I studied how selection in plant gametophytes affects the evolution of both phases of the lifecycle using a combination of population genomics, association mapping studies and experimental crosses. I tested the following questions: 

1. Is there population genomic signal of antagonistic pleiotropy across life stages?
2. Does standing variation in gene expression have differential effects across life stages? 
3. What are characteristics of genetic variation for pollen competition?
