## Unit 2: How to write literature review and introduction?

### How to write a literature review?
* A literature review should
    1. provide a clear picture of the research development so far by sorting out the relationship of previous works.
    2. provide the relationship between previous works and the present study.
    3. prepare for and justify the research questions or hypotheses of the present study.
    4. point out the areas of study so as to avoid repetition.
    5. add authority to the present study


* Organization of a literature review
    1. The chronological format: organize along the timeline,i.e., based on their publication dates.
    2. Thematic format: resolves around specific concepts, topics or issues that are important to the research.
    3. Methodological format: focuses on the methods used by previous researchers instead of the content.
Attention: remember that the literature should not be presented one after another. That is, it should not be a list of summarized works.


* Steps of Writing a Literature Review
Analysis and interpretation: 
    1. read through the references quickly to get a general idea. We can focus on the title, abstract, introduction and conclusion.
    2. Categorize the references. __Classify the references into topics and arrange the references chronologically__.
    3. Keep files and take notes. 
How to take notes?
    1. Publication information. Record the name of the author(s), the publication year, the title of the paper/book,the name of the publisher
    2. __Definition of key terms__. Pay attention to the different definitions of the key terms
    3. Research method
    4. __Conclusion. Summarize the conclusion of the author(s) and be ready to compare and contrast the conclusions__.
    5. __Strengths and weaknesses__: consciously and critically evaluate the literature.
    6. __Relevance to my research__.
    7. Important statistics
    8. Useful quotes


* Common Problems in Writing a Literature Review
    1. Read too much or too little literature.
    2. Cannot find enough literature
    3. the literature review is a totally separate set of references from the paper itself
    4. It is written as a summary or annotated summary at best
    5. Read too much secondary sources instead of primary sources
    6. Quote too much
   

### How to write an introduction?

* The roles of introductions
    1. aroused the interest of readers 
    2. defines the scope and direction, provides background information, and helps readers better navigate the paper
    3. helps readers get familiar with the context of the topic
    4. should be a signal that the paper is well-informed and dependable, knowledgeable, trust-worthy and unbiased

    * General Area Under Study
    * Background information
    * Problem statement
    * purpose statement
    * Research question/ hypothesis
    * Provide the outline of the paper (optional)


* What does a good introduction look like?
1. Open with a broad, general statement
2. Provide background information
    * urgency and significance 
    * the larger picture
    * facts and statistics
    * the key terms and define them
    * adequate, brief and relevant
3. problem statement (What is the need for this study? Lead the reader logically to the followed-up purpose statement)

4. purpose statement (the intent of your study)

5. Research Questions/ Hypotheses
